All files in this repository are related to the paper Computational simulation and the search for a quantitative description of simple reinforcement schedules, by: Paulo Sergio Panse Silveira, Jose de Oliveira Siqueira, Joao Lucas Bernardy, Jessica Santiago, Thiago Cersosimo Meneses, Bianca Sanches Portela and Marcelo Frota Benvenuti.

In our repository you find three files: 

RDRL_Fit.zip: Simulated data and a script written in R to adjust the reinforcement feedback function of three RDRL schedules. 

RI_Fit.zip: Simulated data and R scripts for fitting and comparing reinforcement feedback functions for the RI schedules (see paper for more information) 

RI_Txp_paper.R: A R script for suggested estimation of T and p for a RI schedule (Millenson, 1963) (see paper for more information).
